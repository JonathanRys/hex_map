# Blacksmith Event

**Golden Rule of RR2: Hoard everything.**

The blacksmith event is one of the most useful events in the game.  As with everything in this game, you should keep your chests until they are about to expire or an event comes along where those chests become more useful.  Some players will wait until an event is announced before melting the next week's worth of chests.  And they will stockpile chests from the festival in preparation for events like the blacksmith event.

Chests to save for the Blacksmith event:
 * Uber Chests: It's best to get these from the festival(cheapest way to get them for gems [117 gems/ea.]), in exchange for tickets, or as rewards in wars and ninja events.
 * Gold Chests: This extra gold will be useful for melting all the items from your Uber chests.
 * Epic Chests: save these for when your gold is full or use when you only need a little more gold.
 * Pro Chests: If you have space, open these when you get them because the items are often useful but [see below](#How-to-melt-items) about pro items
 * Other chests: Item chests, Normal; Magic; Rare; Epic; and Legendary chests

### Sources of chests
 * Voucher Bazaar (Uber)
 * Shop (Uber)
 * Festival (Uber)
 * Conquest (Pro)
 * Cave of Grave Goods (Pro)
 * Ninja event (Uber, Pro)
 * Collections (Golden, Pro)
 * Offers (Golden, Pro)
 * Magic Market (Golden, Pro)
 * Seasons (Golden, Pro)
 * War (Uber, Golden, Pro)

### Gold, Legendary, and Epic chests
If your gold is full before you open gold chests (and you don't spend gold melting items you find), you'll get food, but if your food is also full, you'll get pearls instead.  You should always wait to collect your chests from seasons until you need them or seasons ends.  I save gold chests for the blacksmith event to melt items with otherwise I turn them into pearls.  If you only have a few gold chests and you want pearls, check out the tips [below](#Pearl-Farming)

### How to melt items
Once the notification appears saying that a blacksmith event is coming, boost your blacksmith and load it up with any pro items that you can melt.  Load it up a day(less if you have fewer slots) before the event starts, but wait until the event starts to collect those pearls.  It's much harder than it sounds.  I put a sticky note over the button on my screen so I don't press it but have still screwed up.

Once the event begins, start melting your Uber chests and extra items.  Save your remaining Pro items for overnight melting.  Keep your blacksmith full and boosted the entire event.  This will require you to plan ahead in order to do it properly.  It's fairly cheap at this point to click the finish all button to burn through any extra chests you may have but make sure to collect the pearls for melting those items *before* the event ends.

### Importance of getting more blacksmith slots
The number of pearls you get for each item and the time it takes to melt it down improve with every slot purchased.  It is important to get the maximum number of slots as soon as possible in order to boost your hero quickly.  Pearls and runes are the most valuable currencies in the game so unlocking those slots early on increases the rate at which your character grows.

### How to forge items
Pearls can be used to forge units, spells, items, and obstacles.  During the Blacksmith(BS) event, the primary focus should be on your skull perk items

#### Where to start
If you are new to the game or are still low-level then read this section:

 * Start by forging your units because they are used for both attack and defense; getting two rune slots on each of your units should be a priority.
 * Forge your spells and obstacles
 * Forge your items - You want to increase your skull bonus as much as possible. For more info, check out my [war tips](https://hex-map.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/war_tips.html)

### Runes
The only rune that is really relevant to pearl farming is the farmer rune.  The farmer rune reduces the amount of food needed for each battle:
 * Level 1: 7-9%
 * Level 2: 9-11%
 * Level 3: 11-13%
 * Level 4: 13-15%
 * Level 5: 15-17%
 * Level 6: 17-20% + 30-35% Scream boost

The treasure hunter rune doesn't yield any treasure on the low-level bases we'll be raiding while pearl farming so it isn't useful here.


## Pearl Farming
### Who to farm
Search for players named "ppp"-something you will find a large list of player with no alliance and no gate towers.  These player exist to be farmed for pearls.  Feel free to attack them as often as you like.

### Food
Pearl farming requires doing lots of battles and every battle costs food.  Reducing the food cost per battle allows us to do more battles before needing to refill our food.

Food can be replenished from any of the following sources:
 * Boosted farms
 * CoF
 * Vouchers for food
 * Gems for food
 * Using gold chests for food

To get the most food the fastest, max out your gold, run your food out by pearl farming, and then open a gold chest to get your food refilled to the max, then without logging off, keep farming until you run out of food again. At that point, collect the next loaf of bread from that chest until you use all that food.

### Farming gear
There are only three perks that matter for pearl farming:
 * Better % chance for pearls in CoF (200% max)
 * Luck
 * Farmer

Try to maximize pearl chance, then luck with the lowest priority on farmer.  Increasing your luck also increases your chance for getting pearls.

### Farming for speed
Since pearl farming requires lots of battles, reducing the time each battle takes increases the number of battles one can do in a day.

#### Winning quickly
The primary concern is getting 100% and crashing the gate quickly.  The fastest unit in the game by far is the gargoyle.

#### Summoning patterns
Spamming gargoyles might seem like the obvious thing to do, but they clog each other up and all attack the same target so it's faster to summon in batches of 2-3 with a second or two between them.

#### Controlling your mercs
Ninjas:
Zombies: Run forward until they start to appear then run back to your tent.

### Chamber of Fortune
The odds in the Chamber of Fortune are different for each chest and event (ninja, war, conquest)
 * Always collect or sell items, never melt them directly
 * Filling your gold before raiding - trick: use the dungeon gold to top it off

### Other ways to get pearls
 * Secret birthday landscape pearls (chicken drop)
 * Seasons
 * Daily pearls
 * Defense pearls (Hans beast)
 * Hidden treasure drops
